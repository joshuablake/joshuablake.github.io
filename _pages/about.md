Hi there! I am a final-year PhD student at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge.
My research focuses on how we can best use the [ONS's Coronavirus Infection Survey (CIS)](https://ons.gov.uk/cis) to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.
This is an exciting dataset to work with because it contains a representative sample of the UK population, removing many of the concerns around bias present in most data relating to the pandemic.
My current project is to estimate the distribution for the duration of PCR positivity from this data.

My supervisors are [Daniela De Angelis](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/a-to-g/daniela-de-angelis/) and [Paul Birrell](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/a-to-g/paul-birrell/) (who is primarily based at UKHSA), and I am funded by [Bayes4Health](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/bayes-for-health/).

Please explore my work on the rest of this site, and if you would like to get in contact you can find my details in the sidebar on the left; either email or Twitter are likely to get a response.
