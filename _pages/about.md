Hi there! I am a final-year PhD student at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge.
My research focuses on how to best use the [ONS's Coronavirus Infection Survey (CIS)](https://ons.gov.uk/cis) to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.
This is an exciting dataset to work with because it contains a representative sample of the UK population, removing many of the concerns around bias present in most data relating to the pandemic.

More broadly, I am interested in understanding the most cost-effective ways to tackle novel and endemic infectious diseases.
I am always excited to hear about new ideas and interventions in this space, so please do get in touch if you have any (see the sidebar for my details)!

During the pandemic I was a member of [SPI-M-O, the infectious disease modelling and epidemiology subgroup of the UK Government's SAGE](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-pandemic-influenza-subgroup-on-modelling).
Much of the work I did was publicly available, and widely covered in the media.
I also implemented [the method for estimating incidence adopted by the Office for National statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/methodologies/covid19infectionsurveypilotmethodsandfurtherinformation#incidence).

My supervisors are [Daniela De Angelis](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/a-to-g/daniela-de-angelis/) and [Paul Birrell](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/a-to-g/paul-birrell/) (who is primarily based at UKHSA), and I am funded by [Bayes4Health](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/bayes-for-health/).

[I also blog about a variety of things I find interesting but often not directly related to my research.](https://joshuablake.co.uk/blog/)
